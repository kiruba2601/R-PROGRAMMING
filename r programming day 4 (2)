1.(i) Write a R program to extract the five of the levels of factor created
from a random sample from the LETTERS (Part of the base R distribution.)


  (ii)Write R function to find the range of
given vector. Range=Max-Min
Sample input, C<-(9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1),
 output=8

 (iii)Wirte the R function to find the number
of vowels in given string Sample input c<- “matrix”,  output<-2

programs:

#1 i)
sample1=sample(LETTERS, 5)
samplef=factor(sample1)
fflevel=levels(samplef)[1:5]
print(fflevel)

#ii)
e=c(1:9)
s=max(e)
t=min(e)
r=s-t
print(r)

#iii)
str1="Matrix"
str2=strsplit(str1,"")[[1]]
vowels=c("a","e","i","o","u","A","E","I","O","U")
vcount=0
for(char in str2)
{
  if(char %in% vowels)
    
  {
    vcount=vcount + 1
  }
}
print(vcount)


2.Load
inbuild dataset “ChickWeight” in R


    (i) Explore the summary of Data set, like
number of Features and its type. Fins the number of records for each features


  (ii)Extract last 6 records of dataset


   (iii) order the data frame, in ascending
order by feature name  “weight”  grouped by feature “diet”


   (iv)Perform melting function based on “Chick","Time","Diet"   features as ID
variables


   (v)Perform cast function to display the mean
value of weight grouped by Diet


programs:
#2
d=ChickWeight
#i)
str(d)
summary(d)

#ii)
tail(d,6)
#iii)
library(dplyr)
d%>%
  group_by(Diet)%>%
  arrange(weight)
#iv)
library(reshape)
md=melt(d,id=c("Time","Chick","Diet"))
print(head(md))
#v)
cas=cast(md,Diet~.,mean)
print(cas)

3.(i)Get
the Statistical  Summary of  “ChickWeight” dataset
(ii)Create Box plot for “weight”  grouped by “Diet”
(iii)Create a Histogram for  “Weight” features  belong to Diet- 1 category
(iv) Create a Histogram for  “Weight” features  belong to Diet- 4 category
(v) Create Scatter plot  for weight vs Time grouped by Diet

programs:

#3i)
da=ChickWeight

summary(da)
#ii)
boxplot(weight ~ Diet,da=ChickWeight,main ="Weight by
Diet",
        xlab="Diet",ylab="Weight")
#iii)
diet1=d[d$Diet == 1, ]
hist(diet1$weight, main = "Histogram of Weight in Diet-1
Category",
     xlab = "Weight (in grams)", ylab = "Frequency")
#iv)
diet2=d[d$Diet == 4, ]
hist(diet2$weight, main = "Histogram of Weight in Diet-1
Category",
     xlab = "Weight (in grams)", ylab = "Frequency")
#v)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(d, aes(x = Time, y = weight, color = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Weight vs Time Grouped by Diet") +
  xlab("Time (days)") +
  ylab("Weight (grams)")


4.(i) Create multiregression model to find a weight of the chicken , by “Time” and “Diet” as as predictor variables
(ii) Predict weight forTime=10 and Diet=1
(iii)Find the error inmodel for smae

programs:

#4
dat=ChickWeight
#i)
model=lm(weight ~ Time+factor(Diet),dat=ChickWeight)
summary(model)
#ii)
ndata=data.frame(Time = 10,Diet=1)

prediction=predict(model,newdata = ndata)
prediction
#iii)
error=dat[dat$Time==10&dat$Diet==1,"weight"] - prediction
error
